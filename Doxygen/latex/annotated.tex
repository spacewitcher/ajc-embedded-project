Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structbeacon_data}{beacon\+Data}} \\*The \mbox{\hyperlink{structbeacon_data}{beacon\+Data}} struct contains data received from the slave device, such as temperature, pressure, humidity, x, y, z axes positions, detection status and a timestamp }{\pageref{structbeacon_data}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_controller_logic}{Controller\+Logic}} \\*Class for describing the actions that are to be performed by the PCA9685 controller }{\pageref{class_controller_logic}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_i2_c}{I2C}} \\*Class for controlling the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_i2_c}{I2C}} bus }{\pageref{class_i2_c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_pi_p_c_a9685}{Pi\+PCA9685}} \\*Class for controlling the PCA9685 PWM chip }{\pageref{class_pi_p_c_a9685}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_raspberry_master}{Raspberry\+Master}} \\*Used for communication between the Master device, the slave device and the TCP remote server. It contains methods for receiving data from the slave device, changing the format of the data to JSON, and sending the data to a server. It also dictates when the servocontroller should perform its actions }{\pageref{class_raspberry_master}}{}
